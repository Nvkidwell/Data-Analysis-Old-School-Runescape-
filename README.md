# Data-Analysis-Old-School-Runescape-
This project uses a Loot Tracker to analyze in-game drop rates. It organizes and explores loot data, applying regression modeling to predict drop probabilities. The goal is to gain insights into drop patterns and help inform strategy decisions. Perfect for gamers and data enthusiasts interested in statistical analysis of loot systems.

# Loot Tracker Drop Rate Analysis

This repository contains scripts for analyzing in-game drop rates using data collected from a Loot Tracker. The project organizes, explores, and models loot data to predict drop probabilities using regression modeling techniques. It aims to provide insights into loot patterns and inform strategy decisions based on statistical predictions.

## Features
- Organizes loot data from Loot Tracker logs
- Explores loot drop distributions and trends
- Applies regression models to predict drop rates
- Visualizes data with plots and charts

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib or Seaborn (for visualizations)
- Scikit-learn (for regression models)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/loot-tracker-drop-rate-analysis.git
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your Loot Tracker data in CSV format. Sample structure:
    ```csv
    Item,Quantity,DropRate,Date
    Sword,2,0.03,2023-08-01
    Shield,1,0.05,2023-08-01
    ```

2. Run the analysis script to organize and explore your data:
    ```bash
    python analyze_loot_data.py
    ```

3. Apply regression modeling to predict future drop rates:
    ```bash
    python predict_drop_rates.py
    ```

4. Visualize results with plots:
    ```bash
    python plot_results.py
    ```
